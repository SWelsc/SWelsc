Hello everyone and welcome to my github-page!

I have started programming some years ago, when I first got in contact with Linux.

Starting from creating small scripts in bash to automize different kind of CFD simulations, I expanded my personal programming horizon by learning Python.

I used both Python and Linux/Bash quite frequently for improving a lot of aspects of my daily work as simulation engineer ever since, by automatizing repetetive tasks such as data veryfication and analysis.

Ultimately, I also gained some experience in Fortran, when working on a standalone simulation tool at my former workplace.

On my page, I will share some more or less small tools and scripts, that helped me a lot and might also help others for their engineering tasks.

Please note, that I am by no means an authorized IT guy or computer scientists and that I still have a lot to learn. 

So whenever you encounter some obvious bad or wrong programming habits etc. please feel free to comment in a constructive way.

As this is purely a hobby for me, I am afraid I might not be able to answer questions, comments etc. that frequently.
